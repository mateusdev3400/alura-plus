# Alura Plus

## About

This is the development of a project called Alura Plus, presenting some concepts for manipulating elements and positioning with flexbox and grid layout. I can highlight that the most edifying part of this planning was not repeating code, that is, reusing what was repeated.

Divided into two layers main and footer - containing the initial part within the main, and other presentation sections. The footer is made up of an image, list and text, while the other sections are made up of a title, text and image corresponding to the alura's "marketing".
